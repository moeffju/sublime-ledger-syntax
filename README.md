## Installation

The easiest way to install this package is through [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control).

Otherwise, **if you have Git**: clone the repository in your Sublime Text "Packages" directory (Sublime Menu -> Preferences -> Browse Packages…).
**If you don’t have Git**, download the [source zip](https://github.com/moeffju/sublime-ledger-syntax/archive/master.zip) and unpack it into a new directory named `sublime-ledger-syntax` within your Packages directory.
